## Lesson Overview

Welcome to the Fruits App, a full-stack project that helps learners build a Node.js and Express application structured around the Model–View–Controller (MVC) pattern.

In this module, you’ll learn to perform all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) while keeping your code organized into separate folders for models, views, and controllers.
