# ![Update a Fruit](../assets/hero-update-a-fruit.png)

In this lesson, you will be able to create a route that will receive the submission of the form in `/fruits/edit`. This route will update a fruit document in the `fruits` collection in their MongoDB Atlas database.

## The `update` route

In the next section, we will focus on building the `update` route. This route is the final component in completing the CRUD (Create, Read, **Update**, Delete) functionalities of our application. The `update` route is responsible for processing the data submitted from the `edit` form and applying those changes to the corresponding item in the database.

In keeping with RESTful routing conventions, the url for this route will be `/fruits/:fruitId`

## Create the `fruit_update_put` controller

In this controller, we will employ the Mongoose `findByIdAndUpdate()` method. This method allows us to update a specific document in the MongoDB database based on its unique `ID`. Since this is an asynchronous operation, we'll utilize `async/await` to ensure the operation completes before proceeding.

Add this to your controller:

```js
exports.fruit_update_put = async (req, res) => {
  // Handle the 'isReadyToEat' checkbox data
  if (req.body.isReadyToEat === 'on') {
    req.body.isReadyToEat = true
  } else {
    req.body.isReadyToEat = false
  }

  // Update the fruit in the database
  await Fruit.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.fruitId, req.body)

  // Redirect to the fruit's show page to see the updates
  res.redirect(`/fruits/${req.params.fruitId}`)
}
```

Like the `fruit_create_post` controller, the `fruit_update_put` controller requires special data handling for the `isReadyToEat` property. This property, being a checkbox in our form, sends different values based on whether it's checked or not, and we need to handle this in our route to ensure it aligns with our database schema.

After updating the fruit in the database, it's a good practice to redirect the user back to a relevant page. In this case, we redirect the user to the `show` page of the updated fruit. This provides immediate visual confirmation of the changes.

## Create the `update` route

To allow users to `update` a fruit's details, we need to set up an `update` route. This route will handle `PUT` requests sent from the edit form on the `Edit` page. The URL pattern for this route is `/fruits/:fruitId`, where `:fruitId` represents the unique identifier of the fruit being updated.

The `update` route is unique as it specifically deals with `PUT` requests. Since it does not conflict with other routes, its placement within the routes file can be flexible.

```js
// PUT /fruits/:fruitId
router.get('/', fruitsController.fruit_update_put)
```

We can now test the route by submitting our form. Make sure you are redirected correctly and can see your changes.

If you are able to delete a fruit, you have successfully performed your next CRUD operation, **Update**. Congrats!
