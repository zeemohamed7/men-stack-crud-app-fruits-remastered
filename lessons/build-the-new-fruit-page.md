# ![Build the New Fruit Page](../assets/build-the-new-fruit-page.png)

In this lesson, students will be able to construct a `new` route in Express that renders a form for collecting user data.

## Create the `fruit_create_get` controller

```javascript
// GET /fruits/new
exports.fruit_create_get = async (req, res) => {
  res.render('fruits/new.ejs')
}
```

## The `GET /fruits/new` route

Creating a new fruit in our application involves two distinct steps, each handled by separate routes. The first step is presenting the user with a form to enter fruit data. This is the responsibility of the "new" route, which we'll build in this section. Its sole purpose is to display a form for data entry.

In keeping with RESTful routing conventions, the url for this route will be: `/fruits/new`.

Create the route for this controller in `routes/fruit.js`:

```js
// shows the form for creating a new fruit
router.get('/new', fruitsController.fruit_create_get)
```

This defines a GET route at /fruits/new that calls the fruit_create_get function from the controller to render the “New Fruit” form page.

## Create the `new` template

Let's now create the template for our "new" route. This template will provide a user-friendly interface for adding new fruits to our application. To keep our templates organized, especially as our application grows, we'll place this new template in a dedicated sub-folder within the `views` directory.

```bash
mkdir views/fruits
touch views/fruits/new.ejs
```

Organizing our templates into model-specific sub-folders is a good practice, especially for larger applications with multiple models. Each model can have its own `new.ejs` template, among others.

Now, let's add some basic content to our `new.ejs` template for fruits:

```html
<!-- views/fruits/new.ejs -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Create a Fruit</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Create a New Fruit!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Visit `localhost:3000/fruits/new` in the browser. This time we should see the `<h1>` rendered to the page.

## Create the form

Finally, let's add a form to our `new.ejs` template. This form will allow users to input data for creating a new fruit. In our Fruit model, we have two properties: `name` and `isReadyToEat`. The `name` field should be a text input where users can type the name of the fruit. For the `isReadyToEat` property, which is a boolean, we'll use a checkbox input. This way, users can check the box if the fruit is ready to eat.

```html
<!-- views/fruits/new.ejs -->

<body>
  <h1>Create a New Fruit!</h1>
  <form action="/fruits" method="POST">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" />

    <label for="isReadyToEat">Ready to Eat?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="isReadyToEat" id="isReadyToEat" />

    <button type="submit">Add Fruit</button>
  </form>
</body>
```

In the form we've just created, there are two important attributes: `action` and `method`. The `action` attribute specifies the URL where the form data should be sent when the form is submitted. In our case, it's set to `/fruits`. The `method` attribute defines the HTTP `method` the browser should use to send the form data. We've set this to `POST`, which is appropriate for creating new data on the server.

Now that our form is set up, it provides the user interface needed to create a new fruit. However, it's not functional yet. When you try to submit the form, you'll probably see an error message like `Cannot POST /fruits`. This is because we haven't yet created the route to handle the form submission. That's our next step! We'll set up the corresponding server-side route to process and save the form data.
